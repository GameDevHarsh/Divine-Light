# Divine Light

## 🕹️ About the Game
**Divine Light** is a 2D top-down RPG puzzle game developed during a game jam, themed around **Chain Reaction**. You play as an adventurer trapped in a dark maze, guided only by a divine light. Your goal is to strategically place and rotate mirrors to reflect the light, illuminating the path and melting icy doors to escape.
